Changes in Tenet 2.0 - 6/20/2008
========================================
Tenet 2.0 introduces several new platforms/protocols/features over
Tenet 1.x and has been used in seismic and habitat monitoring
deployments for up to a month. It includes:
- Support for Cyclops camera as a sensor
- Support for Mica2/Mica2dot platforms

Features that have been tested in a lab environment but not tested in
deployments yet:
- Centroute is a centralized routing protocol in which the master,
based on the neighborhood information sent by the motes, computes the
routing tree for the mote network.
- Emstar emulation for Tenet so that the developers can test Tenet
code without mote hardware.
- tenet-t2 compiles for TinyOS 2.1 and uses the CTP routing protocol
and supports mote radio dutycycling using the LPL stack in TinyOS 2.1

Changes in Tenet 1.02 - 4/1/2007
========================================
- Python library path bug in netviz is fixed.
- Change of default sampling tasklet: 
  - substitute SlowSample tasklet with SimpleSample tasklet.
  - corresponding changes to tasking API

- Limit number of concurrent connections in sendstr tasklet to 1.
- Modification in TRD packet format for easier packet snooping.
- A bug in Mote routing table is fixed
- Tenet Router ignores communication among other routers if it is
