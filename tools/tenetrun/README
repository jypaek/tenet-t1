Prerequisites for building are gcc, flex, and bison. To build "tenetrun", just type "make".

Syntax to execute a .run file as a foreground process: "tenetrun <name of the .run file>"
Syntax to execute a .run file as a background process: "tenetrun <name of the .run file> daemon"

A few sample ".run" files are provided. For more information about the features of tenetrun, please visit
http://www.lecs.cs.ucla.edu/wiki/index.php/Scripting_language_for_Tenet

If you run "tenetrun" as a daemon process, all the output should go to a file called "tenetrun_output.txt".
