[1] HOW TO RUN

  - install this program to the telosb mote
  - you will see 'blue' led on.
  - wait for about 20~30 seconds.
  - if you see 'green' led on, then you are done.


[2] NOTE

  FLASH (EEPROM) on telosb must be formatted before use.
  And the format must be done in a way that corresponds to it's use.

  Currently, TenetNoTask uses TransportComm as the transport layer.
  TransportComm uses StreamTransportC and TRD_TransportC
  which requires access to Flash.

  So, this "FormatTelosbFlash" program formats the telosb flash for 
  StreamTransportC and TRD_TransportC to use.

  If not formatted correctly, nothing will work.
