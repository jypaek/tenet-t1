This directory is for the cyclops binary:
 the software that goes on to the cyclops.

Compile by,
 $ make cyclops

If this doesn't work, you might want to copy
  ../../platform/cyclops/cyclops.target
file to
  $TOSDIR/../tools/make/
(e.g. /opt/tinyos-1.x/tools/make/cyclops.target)

Upload to the cyclops by,
 $ make cyclops install mib510,/dev/ttyS0
