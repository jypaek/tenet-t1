[Overview]
   This directory contains the "ENLTimer" library. 
   "ENLTimer" is re-implementation and modification of
   Timer and Clock modules in TinyOS-1.x.
   "ENLTimer" provides:
     - System time running at 4.096KHz, (or 32.768kHz)
     - Absolute timer (AKA alarm),
     - Correct timer (1000/1024 problem fixed).



[Features]

   1. No compatibility issue with the Timer/Clock modules in main TinyOS tree.
      (You can use Timer and Clock just as before)

   2. Correct Timer : The Timer in TinyOS has 1000/1024 problem:
                      1ms is not really 1ms, but actually 1000/1024 ms.
                      "ENLTimer" fixed this.

   3. System Time   : "ENLTimer" provides 32-bit system time running at 4.096KHz.
                      You can use this for timesync, TDMA, timestamping... etc.

   4. AbsoluteTimer : Since we now have both 'correct time' and 'system time',
                      we are naturally able to provide absolute timer 
                      based on the system time.
                    


[Files]
   - HPLClock.nc  : Modification to TinyOS HPLClock.
                    Provides system running at 4.096KHz (or 32.768kHz)
                    by using the overflow interrupt of "Clock0".
   - LocalTime.nc : Interface for accessing the system time 
                    provided by HPLClock.
   - ClockC.nc    : Configuration file which uses HPLClock.nc
                    and provides LocalTime.nc
   - TimerM.nc    : Re-implementation of TimerM module in TinyOS.
                    Provides Absolute timer by using the system time
                    of ClockC, and also provides *correct* timer.
   - AbsoluteTimer.nc : Interface for the absolute timer provided by TimerM.
   - TimerC.nc    : Configuration file which uses TimerM.nc
                    and provides AbsoluteTimer as well as Timer interface.



[Usage]
   - For the normal Timer use, you can use "ENLTimer" just as you use
     the Timer in main TinyOS tree.
   - Two additional interfaces are provided :
     -- LocalTime.nc     : You can use this interface to access the 32-bit system time.
     -- AbsoluteTimer.nc : You can use this interface to use the absolute timer.
