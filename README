WELCOME

Tenet is software for flexibly programming a tiered network of
sensors. Tiered networks consist of *motes* (currently Tenet supports
MicaZ and TelosB motes) and PC-class devices that we call *masters*
(our distribution includes binaries for Cygwin, Linux Fedore Core 3,
and Stargates). In Tenet, all applications run on the masters, and
task motes using a simple, yet expressive, linear data-flow tasking
language. 

This is an alpha release, since much of Tenet is under active
development. It is designed to give you a feel for some of Tenet's
main features:

- As an application developer, you don't have to write code for the
motes in order to develop your applications. In fact, you don't even
have to compile code for the motes -- our distribution includes a
pre-compiled Tenet binary image for MicaZ and TelosB.

- We provide several pre-compiled applications (more on this in the
installation instructions), but we also have included the ability for
you to compile your own Tenet application.

- You can run multiple applications concurrently, as described in the
installation instructions.

If you have any questions about this release, please feel free to
email tenet-users@enl.usc.edu. You may join this list to participate
in discussions about tenet.
